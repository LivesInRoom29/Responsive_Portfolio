# Responsive_Portfolio

## Description

With this project, I built a portfolio website from scratch using Bootstrap 4 to help ensure that it looks appropriate on screens of all different sizes.

[My Portfolio]https://livesinroom29.github.io/Responsive_Portfolio/)

## Learning Outcomes

* Bootstrap 4 and Responsiveness
  * Spent a good deal of time reading the Bootstrap documentation on different elements that I wanted in the portfolio.
  *

* HTML semantics
  * Lots of practice with building different parts of a wesbite - from the nav bar to contact forms to cards and footers.
  * Utilized the Bootstrap Grid System to organize content on the page.


* Cascading styles
  * Used CSS in addition to Bootstrap classes to change the placement and styles of elements.
  * Became more familiar with how to pinpoint elements with classes and IDs.


## Credits

Thanks to the UNH Bootcamp instructors, TAs, and tutors for answering my questions and just generally helping me to learn so much in such a short period!

Thanks as well to my classmates for sharing their questions in class and during office hours, which definitely helped me to understand better as well.
